# odin-recipes

This project is a basic html recipe website with three recipes posted into it based on my personal favorites. 

This demostrates basic html code with links to pages as linked text in the main page with a link to go back home from the recipe page. 

The project was updated through git which was also another skill practiced in this project.

I learned how to use git to update a project and doing so with proper titles for the commits.
