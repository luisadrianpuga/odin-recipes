        <p>Carne asada tacos are the first tacos in history. It is believed that the first tacos appeared in the 1500s, made with thin slices of meat cooked over hot coals. The meat was placed in a corn tortilla and topped with guacamole, onions, chili peppers, and lime â€“ also known as the carne asada taco. </p>

        <h2>Ingredients:</h2>        
        <ul>
            <li>2 pounds flank or skirt steak, trimmed of excess fat</li>
            <li>Olive Oil</li>
            <li>1/2 cup Pico de Gallo, recipe follows</li>
            <li>16 (7-inch) corn tortillas</li>
            <li>Chopped white onion, for serving</li>
            <li>Kosher salt and freshly ground black pepper</li>
        </ul>

        <h2>Steps</h2>
        <ol>
            <li>Lay the flank steak in a large baking dish and pour the mojo over it. Wrap tightly in plastic wrap and refrigerate for 1 hour or up to 8 hours, so the flavors can sink into the meat. Don't marinate the steak for more than 8 hours though, or the fibers break down too much and the meat gets mushy.</li>
            <li>Preheat an outdoor grill or a ridged grill pan over medium-high flame (you can also use a broiler). Brush the grates with a little oil to prevent the meat from sticking. Pull the steak out of the mojo marinade and season the steak on both sides with salt and pepper. Grill (or broil) the steak for 7 to 10 minutes per side, turning once, until medium-rare. Remove the steak to a cutting board and let it rest for 5 minutes to allow the juices to settle. Thinly slice the steak across the grain on a diagonal.
            </li>
            <li>Warm the tortillas for 30 seconds on each side in a dry skillet or on the grill, until toasty and pliable.</li>
            <li>To make the tacos, stack up 2 of the warm tortillas, lay about 4 ounces of beef down the center, and sprinkle with some lettuce, onion, and cheese. Top each taco with a spoonful of the Pico de Gallo salsa and garnish with lime wedges. Repeat with the remaining tortillas.</li>
        </ol>
